# Injecting different numbers

## Working mechanism

A *rpi-dht22* node is added to the flow, which can take measurements
with a DHT-22 sensor (connected to one of the GPIOs of the Raspberry Pi).
Measurements are triggered by an arbitrary message sent to the input
of the node. Trigger messages are generated by an *inject* node (labelled
*timestamp*) in every 5 sec.

Fixed test measurements can be injected with the 4 *inject* nodes.

Measurements are written to the debug tab and displayed on a *chart*.
